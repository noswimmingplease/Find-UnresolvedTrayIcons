## Purpose

Report unresolved Windows tray-icon executable references in the current user registry so stale notification-area entries can be identified safely before any cleanup.

## What it does

- Reads tray entry data under `HKCU:\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings`.
- Resolves environment variables and known-folder GUID prefixes.
- Extracts executable paths from command-line style registry values.
- Filters out packaged app paths under `\WindowsApps\`.
- Returns only unresolved entries where the target executable path is missing.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+.
- Access to the current user registry hive (`HKCU`).

## Usage

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\noswi\Desktop\Scripts\Find-UnresolvedTrayIcons"
.\Find-UnresolvedTrayIcons.ps1
```

## Output

- `Key` – registry item name.
- `ResolvedPath` – interpreted executable path.
- `RawPath` – original registry value.

## Troubleshooting

- No rows returned: there are no unresolved entries matching current heuristics.
- A path looks incorrect: check `RawPath` and confirm expected app behaviour.
- Some entries are not listed when they do not resolve to drive-letter paths.

## Safety

This script is read-only and does not write to the registry.
